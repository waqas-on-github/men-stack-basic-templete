High-Level Design (HLD) for Blood Bank Web Application:

Client-side:

The client interacts with the web application through a web browser.
The UI is designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide a user-friendly interface.
Server-side:

The server is built using Node.js and Express to handle HTTP requests and responses.
The application is connected to the MongoDB database to store and retrieve data.
MongoDB stores user details, donor information, hospital details, and blood bank inventory.
Authentication and Authorization:

User authentication is implemented using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure login sessions.
The server verifies the JWT for each request to ensure authorized access to specific functionalities.
Donor Module:

Donors can register, log in, and provide their information through the web application.
Donors can update their availability status and last donation date.
Hospitals can search for donors based on blood group and location to request blood donations.
Hospital Module:

Hospitals can register, log in, and update their blood bank information through the web application.
Hospitals can post their blood bank information, including available blood groups and quantities.
Hospitals can search for donors based on blood group and location to request blood donations.
Blood Bank Search and Matching:

When a hospital searches for donors, the server queries the database to find suitable donors matching the requested blood group and location.
The server then returns the list of available donors to the hospital.
Middleware and Error Handling:

Middleware functions handle various aspects such as authentication, database connections, and request/response formatting.
Error handling mechanisms ensure graceful handling of exceptions and errors, providing appropriate feedback to users.
Deployment:

The web application is deployed on a server with a domain name, allowing users to access it from any location.
